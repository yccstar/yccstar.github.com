    <title><![CDATA[Last Day Trip in Plymouth and the End]]></title>
    <url>%2FTravelling%2FLast-Day-Trip-in-Plymouth-and-the-End%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[I should admit that Time truly flies so quickly! During these several months, lots of things happened and changed my entire life. But all things are good and I am very happy about my decision. Anyway, I’m going to finish this travelling series as now I’m planning a new trip next year with my wife! Half day in PlymouthI have to say, if we have more time, I’d like to stay in Plymouth for at least one week. Unfortunately, we only had half day. But, we were lucky as the weather was really nice for the half day. No words can represent pictures! We had a full English breakfast (instead of Irish breakfast) in the hotel: Recommend this hotel, very nice staff and room: Plymouth Lighthouse - Smeaton’s Tower: Royal Citadel, Plymouth: Mayflower Steps: Local Street: In some local streets, we found few interesting antique shops. We only picked one shop to have a quick glance and left very soon. Back to BristolAfter lunch, we decided to go back. We had to return our car to Bristol airport. It’s about 2 hours driving, but at that day, we met a serious traffic accident. The M5 motorway was blocked entired for 2 exits so we got stuck and delayed for almost 3 hours. When we finally arrived the airport, our flight was already gone. Then, thanks to my smart darling, we took the train over night to the Birmingham and took the flight back to Shannon directly next early morning. EndThis series of travelling blogs took me a while to finish. However, it’s roughly completed now. I planned to finish it ASAP back to May but there were lots of big changes happened in my life. So, my apologies for people who are waiting to see my updates (if there is…) and I will keep updating more reguarly as possible as I can and share more my thoughts and life to you. Thank you again for your watching and hope you enjoy it. See you in the next article. Good night.]]></content>

    <title><![CDATA[Day 7 in Cornwall]]></title>
    <url>%2FTravelling%2FDay-7-in-Cornwall%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[It’s nearly the end of our trip in the UK. In Day 7 &amp; 8, we chose the Cornwall - a county on England’s rugged southwestern tip as our last stop. It’s actually a peninsula encompassing wild moorland and hundreds of sandy beaches, culminating at the promontory Land’s End. Due to the short of time, we only chose several remarkable spots to stop and visit. Long drive, long journey, something interesting happened, some were actually scary. Let’s get started! Tintagel - History meets LegendOur first stop is Tintagel. It’s supposed to be the birthplace of King Arthur. Personally I’m very fond of the global history and legends, especially some stories of King Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table. Unfortunately, the Tintagel castle was closed when we visited there. So we just walked around but there were still some nice photos: Probably my favourite photo during the trip! St.IvesAfter Tintagel, we approached to St.Ives. St. Ives is a very small village. However, the most annoying story was happened here - I literally reversed the car from the bottom of narrow road back to the top. The consequence was that I nearly burned my clutch!! As I said, St. Ives is a tiny village so most of roads are extremely narrow. In addition, it’s built near the sea so the whole village is built along the hill. It causes lots of roads in the village was with angles about 30 degree to 45 degree. Because we were not familiar with directions, we had to follow the navigation. Just in a one-way narrow road, we turned in but blocked by a large construction truck. We had to reverse back with nearly 40 degree angles from bottom to top!! Luckily, I got two full licences in both China and Ireland so I was able to handle it. Even though, I still nearly burned my clutch because the road was so sharp and narrow, I had to hold clutch and the speed in order to keep the car in the middle of the road, not scratching the wall on both sides. In the end, I successfully reversed the car but got drenched thoroughly. We only took few photos in St.Ives as the weather was very bad. Land’s EndDue to the extra hours wasted in St. Ives, when we arrived in Land’s End, it nearly became dark. It was very strong wind and rain. The tourist centre was closed so we could only take some photos quickly. In the EndAs we planned, after Land’s End, we drove to Plymouth to stay overnight. In my next blog, I will talk about our last day trip in Plymouth and Cornwall. Hope you guys like my travelling blogs. See you next time! Have a good night.]]></content>

    <title><![CDATA[Self-driving tour in Bristol]]></title>
    <url>%2FTravelling%2FSelf-driving-tour-in-Bristol%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[It was a long time since last blog as quite busy in the work at the moment. Considering the time passed since Feb, I’m going to end up this series of travelling blogs as soon as possible. Probably another one or two blogs will be going further. Afterwards, I really want to catch up something which I have learned and researched in my recent work and spare time and shared to you. Life is not just work and travelling, isn’t it? Day 6 in BristolAfter rushed exploring the Bath, we took the bus to Bristol Airport on Day 5 afternoon. The reason we approached to Airport first because we planned to self-driving from Bristol and around Cornwall! Pick up the carWe reserved a can in advance from Enterprise Rent A Car (they are a nice company personally speaking) and because I had full Irish driving licence and membership of them, the whole process was smooth and fast. We picked up a Renault Clio, nice and clean, manual and diesel. Good enough. Driving in the UKActually it’s my first time to drive in the UK, well except the last time I drove to Northern Ireland. However, there are differences regarding to the roads and traffic. Bristol is not a big city but the traffic was busy enough. The roads in the England truly are much wider then in the Ireland due to the amount of cars running. To be honest, it made me quite nervous especially we were not familiar with the direction. All we could do was to follow the navigation. Sometimes, if I passed the correct exit juntion, I need to drive a while and turn back in order to get out from the main road. Clifton Suspension BridgeThe most famous landmark in Bristol is Clifton Suspension Bridge. You can easily find the detailed description so I won’t talk more here. I had two feelings towrds to the bridge: It’s truly very high; The best view is not on the bridge. Here are two photos which my girl took (I was driving!): Tip: It’s better to park before you drive through the bridge as it will charge 1 pound for car but free for pedestrians. In addition, the whole bridge is not very long so it’s easily to miss beautiful views via driving. Well, to be frank, it’s really hard to find a suitable parking place! Finger crossed! Bristol City CentreAfter driving around the city, we entered into the city centre and found a large shopping mall, parked the car and enjoyed the dinner there. Afterwards, because it’s winter time, the sky went dark very eariler. We walked around the city centre then drove to our accommodation. In the EndWe only spent less than 1 day in Bristol (actually one afternoon and one night), we prepared the last 2 days of our journey towards to Cornwall. So, in the next one or two (maximum) blogs, I will talk about the last 2 days’ journey. Trust me, it’s worthwhile to read and very unforgettable. Hope to see you soon in my next blog! Have a good evening.]]></content>

    <title><![CDATA[The Roman Bath]]></title>
    <url>%2FTravelling%2FThe-Roman-Bath%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[After 4 days in London, we took the train from Paddington Station (Yes, paddington bear lives there) and went towards Bath. Day 5 in BathAs name self-explained, Bath is named because it was the place for Romans to take shower. We actually arrived in the afternoon on Day 4 so we stayed overnight in the Bath. Well, since we stayed in Bath, we literally chose a spa to experience the real roman bath. There are lots of spa places in the Bath, according to our own experience, I recommend this one - “Thermae Bath Spa”. Two reasons: It’s very closed to the central area (nearby The Roman Bath Museum and Bath Abbey); It has an open rooftop swimming pool. Here is the map: The Roman Bath MuseumIt’s probably the most famous place and a “must-to-go” place when you visit the Bath as the whole city was created for that purpose. There are loads of history stories and ancient stuff back to 2,000 years ago. I don’t want to introduce very detailed about the history here (you can find them online everywhere), just wanna to share some beatiful photos which I took inside. Here we go, the first one is always the most famous one:The Roman Bath! Roman’s goddess - Sulis Minerva and the Gorgon’s head which dominates the Roman Temple pediment: The Roman Empire Map: The Great Bath: It seems people from different countries over the world all like to throw coins into the pool! Tried one tiny drink, not fancy actually: Bath AbbeyIt’s actually free to visit but just require donation. It’s not allowed to take photos inside officially, but took just one ;) Inside of Bath Abbey: But outside are absolutely beautiful: Small ground: Jane Austen - Bath’s most famous residentUnfortunately, we didn’t have enough time to explore the centre but if you like Jane Austen, it’s a place you must to visit in the Bath: The CircusHistoric architectural landmark featuring townhouses curving around a circular grassy area. Personally, I like this type of Geroge buildings as I have worked in such building for nearly 3 years in Limerick city centre. Still remember three words I learned about the building - Fan light, Light well and Foot strap. The Royal CrescentAnother Georgian-era residences: Pulteney BridgeAnother landmark which built in 1774 and inside of Parade Gardens Bath In the endThere are acutally more museums and gardens in the Bath very worth visiting and exploring. However, we only stayed there one night and half day so didn’t get enough time. In addition, my girlfriend and I both very liked this city, small, clean, full of Historic buildings and also lots of shops. University of Bath is very top ranked among all British universities. It’s probably very good to study and live in this city. In the next article, I will introduce our self-driving trips in the western-east of England - Day 6 in Bristol! Happy Bank Holiday tomorrow and have a good night!]]></content>

    <title><![CDATA[Top of London and Stay in Bath]]></title>
    <url>%2FTravelling%2FTop-of-London-and-Stay-in-Bath%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[It has been quite busy rencetly at work so I stop writing this series of articles for few days. However, firstly I wish ya all have a good Easter holiday and enjoy this long weekend (if you live in Ireland)! Day 4: The ShardThe Shard is located very close to London bridge and it is required pre-booked ticket in order to go to the top of the building. To be honest, the entrance of the Shard is quite confused, I still remember we arrived a little bit earlier at that day but was very hard to find the door. However, it’s definitely a must-to-go place with my own experience. We were very luckly that day the weather was extremely beatiful (Well, I heard about they “might” be refund you if the weather is too bad, not sure about that). No more words, here are photos!!! Closer: The View of the Shard: In addition, there is VR experience device over there which you can enjoy. But we didn’t participate because it was quite early that day and the device was not set up yet. Borough MarketNext to the Shard, one street opposite, there is a very local market called - “Borough Market”. Very like the Milk Market in Limerick or English Market in Cork, just much bigger. My girl was very happy about the food and everything in the market. The Whole Pig: Melted Cheese Burger: Different Mushrooms: Back to London EyeAfter the Shard, we took the tube and back to the London Eye. Here are some nice photos again… This angle is probably the most popular one for the photo of London Eye, thanks to GoPro! This one is taken by my phone: At that day, the Big Ben was under construction so it was covered by scaffold and hangings. If you are the first time to visit London, unfortunately, bad luck… Another angle of London Eye: Westminister Bridge: Until now, it’s the end of our 4 days trip (actually 3 days and half) in London. From here, we were leaving London and going to the West of England! In my next article, I will show you our Day 4 evening and Day 5 trip in the Bath! See you in the next article!]]></content>

    <title><![CDATA[Watford Junction London - Harry Potter!]]></title>
    <url>%2FTravelling%2FWatford-Junction-London-Harry-Potter%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Day 3: The Making of Harry Potter - Warner Bros. Studio TourBack to 2015, when I first visited London, my friend told me there is a very fantastic Studio for filming Harry Potter, not in London but quite close. As for me, I’m a big fan of Harry Potter, but only for books. I only watched the first Harry Potter movie - “Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone”. Last April, I travelled to Edinburgh, where J.K Rowling wrote the manuscript. Here is the famous birthplace of Harry Potter: Back to this year, we knew there are always high demand for the tickets of this studio, so the first thing we did was to book the tickets online. I’d say it’s safe to book prior 2 - 3 months. The location of the studio is called Watford. It’s not within the London area so you can’t take tube to go there. You have to take the train to get there. Pay attention when you choose the train. There are loads of trains running through Watford but it’s better to choose the shortest time (Well, it’s up to you if you don’t mind staying more time in the train). We started from Euston Railway Station and took about half an hour to arrive in Watford Junction. Then just at the exit of station, you will find a bus shuttle waiting for you. You only need to show the driver the ticket then they will let you in for free. Here is the entrance of the studio: There is only one word to describe the whole studio - Phenomenal! I don’t think the plain texts will describe fully, only you yourself explore there will experience this feeling. In order to save time, I just pick up several photos which I suppose the best. Hogwarts Door: Gryffindor Uniform: Great Hall: All Wands: Dumbledore Office: Gryffindor Common Room: Large Clock: Diagon Alley: Butter Bear: 9-3-4 Platform: Hogwarts Express: All designs on the wall: Hogwarts Model: Hogwarts Large Model: Hogwarts Model in the Dark: Entrance: Oxford Street back in LondonTea Shop in Oxford Street: Oxford Street Night: That’s bascially what we explored in our Day 3 trip. In the next article, which would be the Day 4, we would visit to the tallest building in the london - The Shard and very nice local market - The Borough Market. After that, we would leave London and move to our next city - Bath! So, see you guys in my next article. Welcome to leave the comments below. Have a good night!]]></content>

    <url>%2FTravelling%2FSpring-Festival-Journey-with-Dr-Shu%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Day 1: Arrive in LondonSt. Paul’s CathedralActually I went to St. Paul’s Cathedral back to 2015, my first time to visit London. However, I didn’t go into the builiding because of the lacking of the time. I still remember at that time, we finished exploring the Tate Modern Museum, going across the millennium bridge, then had a nice, Itanlian (or French) style food. I think it’s Burger as I didn’t know so many English or French words, so can’t even order the food. This time, we booked the tickets and went inside of St. Paul’s Cathedral. It was the tallest building in the London for many years until The Shard and Sky Gardern built up. Unfortunately, it wasn’t allowed to take photos inside of the main building so there are no photos to show. Here is a photo which I took from outside: In the cathedral, actually you can climb up to the top. There are three Galleries you can reach. First one is called - “Whispering Gallery”, you need to climb from the ground floor, all the way up, about 257 steps. It was actually built for workers to maintence and fix the dome but it’s open for visitors now. I climbed up and looked down upon - Unreal view from top to the whole ground floor. What a pity I couldn’t take a photo! After “Whispering Gallery”, about 376 steps up, there is a level called - “Stone Gallery”. From here, actually you can go outside to view the scenes of the central London. Some photos I took from there: Another 152 steps up, you will reach the top of the cathedral - “Goldern Gallery”. It’s quick small but the view from there were even better because of the height. Personal Rate: 5 Star, highly recommended.Day 2: East of LondonArcelorMittal Orbit &amp; The SlideI never went to the east part of London, especailly the CBD along the River Thames. In the early morning, we firstly took the underground to the London Stadium. It was the main area of London Olympic Game back to 2012. Over there, there is a tall sculpture built for the 2012 Olympic Games offering panoramic views &amp; a looping tunnel slide. East of London on the map: ArcelorMittal Orbit &amp; Slide I brought the GoPro camera and took a very nice video about the Orbit and the Slide. Unfortunately, I have to find a way to insert a video into the hexo blog. Will update the video in the later blog. Greenwich - ROGAfter exploring the Olympic Stadium and ArcelorMittal Orbit, we took the DLR train towards the south, across the river and arrived in Grennwich. The Greenwich is quite famous because of astronomical observatory and Prime Meridian. ROG - Royal Observatory Greenwich The Prime Peridian Telescope The telescope there reminded me the trip to the Birr Castle in Co. Offaly, Ireland. Inside of Birr Castle, there is a much bigger one over there. After ROG, we went to National Maritime Museum, which just besides the foot of ROG. Very interesting museum! A ship in bottle: The different heads of ships: In the evening, we went back to the central of London and here are some beautiful photos there: The tower of London: The tower castle: London evening: Oringinally I planned to finish all 7 days within one blog. However, I realize it’s too long and sometimes make me very tired of continuing to extending the same blog. So I decide to create several new blogs describing our trip in the rest of days. Believe me, we experienced loads of things, including missing the flight, nearly 3 hours’ congestion in UK motorway etc. I will aslo try to enable the comment feature of the hexo so leave me comments below! See you in the next blogs!]]></content>

    <title><![CDATA[GOT Journey in Northern Ireland]]></title>
    <url>%2FTravelling%2FGOT-Journey-in-Northern-Ireland%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[In the beginningThis article is probably my first travelling blog which I wished to write something about travelling for a long time. To be honest, I don’t have many personal favourite habits except for driving, travelling and watching films. I’m also not a big fan of series as they are sometimes too long to finish, taking me so much time. So far, I only watched two series entirely. One is BBC - Sherlock Holmes, the other is HBO - Game of Thrones (GOT). And GOT probably is the longest series I still insisted to finish as highly recommended by Diarmuid and Brenny. I still remember it was in 2016, summer time. My first Annual Holiday after starting my career. I aggressively started from Season 1, only spent 2 weeks to catch up until Season 6. Since that time, I become a loyal fan of GOT, as the same feeling to Sherlock Holmes. Before start To be honest, it’s a little bit rushed and not well-thinking when I made this decision. Actually it does cause quite “serious” trouble - My GF was pissed off! I know it’s not her fault and she cared about me, just worried about my safety. Anyway, the decision I made was - Driving all the way from Limerick to Belfast, on my own, late in the evening and the weather was shit as always in the winter! On the way to BelfastOn Friday evening, I hired a car from Enterprise. However, when I got the car, it’s actually 6.30 p.m. As you know, in the winter time, the sky always became dark quite early. So when I really started from my home, it’s already 7.05 p.m. First trouble in the motorwayIn the first half an hour, everything was fine and I filled in enough fuel to my car and listened music. While driving on the M7, near M7 Toll station, suddenly, a yellow-warning light came out in the car dashboard said - Loss of Pressure: Front-left tyre! It was quite scary because I was driving nearly 120 km/h in the M7 motorway! And it is my first time to meet this situation. I pulled the car in the hard shoulder then called the Roadside service. Luckily, there was very quick response and a mechanician came in, checked the wheel and tyre. Nothing wrong, no stone, no nail, the tyre was still hard, not soft. Eventually, he pumped in some of air and reset the car computer. After a long time driving, I finally arrived in Belfast and saw my cousin. He is also a big fan of GOT! Brothers are brothers ;) Scene 1: The Dark Hedges [ Kings Road ]It’s actually my second time to visit the Dark Hedges. Back to 2015, I went here before but at that time, I even didn’t know there was a series called Game of Thrones! The scene in the episode: Photos I took in 2015: Photos I took in 2018: Scene 2: Downhill Beach [ Dragonstone ]The scene in the episode: The photo I took in 2018: Scene 3: Ballintoy [ Iron Islands ]The scene in the episode: Photos I took in 2018: Scene 4: Castle Ward [ Winterfell ]The scene in the episode: Photos I took in 2018: Other ScenesDuring the weekend, we also went to Shane’s Castle, which located just outside the Belfast, supposed to be the jousting tournament near King’s Landing. However, when we arrived there, it was completely private area and we were not allowed to enter. Another scene we didn’t go to was Tollymore Forest Park, which was The Haunted Forest. It’s more close towards to Dublin direction but didn’t get the time to drive there. Another time! In general, here are some useful links which I used to make the travelling plan: http://www.ireland.com/en-us/articles/game-of-thrones-locations/ http://www.travelandleisure.com/slideshows/game-of-thrones-travel-guide https://www.irelandbeforeyoudie.com/game-of-thrones-filming-location2s-in-northern-ireland/ Hope this article will help you if you plan to explore GOT in Northern Ireland via self-driving. Always remember, keep safe driving! Valar Morghulis]]></content>

    <title><![CDATA[How to use Git Submodule to manage Hexo themes]]></title>
    <url>%2FGit%2FHow-to-use-Git-Submodule-to-manage-Hexo-themes%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[In the last blog How to update Hexo and Hexo theme properly, I manage both Hexo blog and Hexo themes as Git Repositories. However, I met a problem when I push everything to remote repo and tried to pull to another PC/Mac. Where is my theme? The image below you will probably see: As you can see in the screenshot, both edinburgh and next are shown differently with landscape. If in this case, you pull the whole repo to another laptop, you will surprisely find these two themes are autually empty! What’s going on?I don’t want to talk from the beginning about the concept of Git Submodule. Here is an article explained extremely great. https://chrisjean.com/git-submodules-adding-using-removing-and-updating/ In this blog, I just want to show you how I use git submodules to update, manage Hexo themes. My personal workflow to manage Hexo themesBecause we still need to update themes by merging upstream from original theme repo, so it’s better to keep themes folder as git repo. If you go through the article I shared above, you will basically know Git Submodule is just kind of reference or path if there is git repo totally under another git repo. After adding git submodules, you will have a new file called - .gitmodules, which pointing out the path to the submodules. So, if I do some changes in the theme file, for example, I update the theme or change some settings in the theme _config.yml file. Navigate to theme folder, commit and push all changes. This step is just committed to theme repo; Navigate back to the Hexo root folder, you will see changes for the theme folder, for example, /themes/next. In this case, you need to commit the theme folder, then push. Migrate to another environment Clone Hexo git repo. But in this stage, you only find empty theme folders; Navigate to theme folder, Initialize the submodule(s) $ git submodule init We need to run the update in order to pull down theme files and populate submodules $ git submodule update That’s it. With all actions above, you’re able to manage Hexo themes via submodules easier and smoother. Well, it took me a while to figure it out, I still remember that I spent nearly 3 days working on this issue (I thought it’s something wrong with Git!). Hope it will help you if you meet the same problem like me. Have a good night!]]></content>

    <url>%2FHexo%2FHow-to-update-Hexo-and-Hexo-theme-properly%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[In the previous blog, I introduced how to update Hexo and Hexo theme - NexT. However, since Hexo 3.0, it’s recommended to install hexo-cli, which is command line interface for hexo. Install Hexo$ npm install hexo-cli -g which install hexo-cli globally Update HexoBecause Hexo is managed by npm, so the update command should be: Change into blog directory with package.json file Run npm update Update Hexo theme - NexTThe current theme I’m using for this blog is NexT. It’s originally developed by a Chinese developer - Vi. However, in Dec.2017, for some reasons, it switched to a Russian developer to manage and maintain. The theme is rebased to Version 6.0.0 and moved to an entire new Git repo. Original Repo:https://github.com/iissnan/hexo-theme-next New Repo:https://github.com/theme-next/hexo-theme-next From what I can see, it seems this Russian developer is very keen on the NexT, which is really great. He’s working with other Chinese developers, building the new official website for NexT theme and keep fixing bugs, adding features etc. New Link: https://theme-next.org/ There are 3 days left to be launched. Personally I’m really looking forward to the new website and hope in some stage, I can get involved in this great project. Back to the topic, because installing the Hexo theme is actually clone the theme repo and enable it in the Hexo root _config.yml file. So, to update the theme, it’s just git pull from original theme repo and it will fetch and merge automatically (if no conflicts happened, finger crossed!). The command will be: $ git pull There are two situations I would like to emphasize: If you forked the theme to your own Repo, you need to add original Repo as upstream remote Repo. Step 1: $ git remote add upstream {remote Repo link} Step 2: $ git remote -v to check whether added Step 3: $ git fetch upstream Step 4: $ git checkout master Step 5: $ git merge upstream/master Git Submodule topic (I will talk about it tomorrow) That’s all today. I will talk about git submodule this concept and how I use Git Submodule feature in the workflow of building and maintaining this blog. See you tomorrow.]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Hello, everyone. Since last blog - “New Journey Step 1: Update Hexo and Hexo theme”, again it’s been a while to write any new content right here. Until Dec.2017, I suddenly found my previous domain name dandyxu.com is expired because I forgot to renew and if I decide to renew it, I have to pay Godaddy extra more. (around 100 euro), which I don’t think it makes any sense although .com domain name is very common and popular. After a couple of days’ thinking, I decide to buy this new domain name - dandyxu.me which is suitable for the purpose of this site. Project Showcases A place which I can write and share anything Following above 2 targets, I literally re-created the entire hexo blog. Doing following changes: Register dandyxu.me in Godaddy Update source code of hexo and update hexo to latest version: 3.4.4 (20 Dec 2017) Update hexo-next theme and rebase with new repo Add next and other themes as git submodules Learn how to manage hexo source code in different devices (tested in my working Win10 laptop and my personal Macbook Pro) Config many features in the next theme more and more… Since I only wrote two blogs in 2017, I suppose 2018 will be a good start to run this blog and write, share my knowleges more often. It’s also very good for conclusion and figuring out what I learn and experiece while I’m working. It’s already too late in the evening so I probably decide to sleep soon. In the next blog, I’d like to describe how I update hexo with new methods and manage source codes in various devices. Good night!]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Hello, everybody. It’s such a long time not to update this blog. Approximately half a year. Time flies quickly, isn’t it? However, as I wrote in the title, it’s a new journey just get started since I decided to keep writing something. But, first step 1 will be updating this “out-of-date” blog as I already left it for nearly 6 months. So, firstly I’m going to do is to update the hexo framework. Here is the procedure which I found: Change into blog directory with package.json file run npm install hexo Check the version of Hexo run hexo version Original Link: https://darkalexwang.github.io/2017/04/05/Update-Hexo/ Secondly, my current hexo theme is Next. So I looked into their github repo, which is https://github.com/iissnan/hexo-theme-next You can easily use git pull to pull out new updates from theme github repo. Easy enough! That’s it. Hope it will help you figure out when you leave your hexo blog for a long while (like me) and wanna to keep updated with latest codes before you get started your new journey. See you guys in next article! Hope you all have a good weekend.]]></content>
